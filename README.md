- 👋 Hi, I’m @ckziemann
- 👀 I’m interested in finance/investing & sports gambling, and (poorly attempting) to build predictive models accordingly
- 🌱 I’m currently teaching myself anything necessary (beginner-intermediate coding skills, stronger math/statistics/data skills) 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on coding vs data/math -- I can help with data analysis if you help me with the development :) 
- 📫 How to reach me TBD
